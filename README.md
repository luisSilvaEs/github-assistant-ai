# Proyect: GitHub Assistant AI using MCP

A weekend project that connects a React UI to OpenAI's **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to perform GitHub operations using natural language.

The app allows users to:

- Ask for their latest commits in a repository
- Trigger GitHub actions like creating branches
- Interact with a memory-aware assistant powered by OpenAI's Assistants API
